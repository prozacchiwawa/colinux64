Page allocation:

lpag_t is a logical pfn; an index to a pte in 0xffff8800'00000000 space.
pgd_t contains a real physical address so it works properly with page tables.

page allocation returns lpag_t, free consumes lpag_t.  This makes the buddy
allocator work properly.

page tables produce and consume pgd_t, which makes them work properly.
we can use the type system to repair inconsistencies.
